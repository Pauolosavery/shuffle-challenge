## Shuffle an array
 
In this task, you have to write a shuffle() method that shuffles all the elements of the array in random order

If you have trouble developing your own shuffle algorithm, try implementing [the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle).



### Release 0.

Write a `shuffle()` method that receives an array and returns a new array with all the elements in a random order. One important property of a good `shuffle()` method is that every transposition is equally likely.

*Note:* Although not required, you can use `Math.random()`.

**Rules and restrictions:**

- Your method will always change the order of the elements on its input. Although you can shuffle the array and get the elements in the same order, we won't allow that.
- your method must not change the input (the method must be non-destructive).

Don't forget to write tests to check your method.
